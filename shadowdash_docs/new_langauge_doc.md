# ShadowDash New Language Design Manifest Documentation

The `shadowdash_test/manifest.h` file defines the interface and internal logic for ShadowDash, a build configuration framework inspired by Ninja. This document is structured to first introduce **how to use the framework** and then dive into the **design logic**.

## How to Use ShadowDash with Newly Designed Language

The primary user-facing elements of ShadowDash are macros designed for defining rules, builds, pools, and defaults concisely. Below are the macros and how to use them, followed by a full example.

### 1. Key Macros

| Macro          | Description                                         | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `let`          | Define a variable with a name and value.            | `let(my_var, "value"_l);`                                              |
| `bind`         | Create a key-value binding for a rule or build.     | `bind(command, "g++ -c in"_v);`                                        |
| `new_pool`     | Define a resource pool with a maximum concurrency.  | `new_pool(my_pool, 4);`                                                |
| `default`      | Set default build targets.                          | `default("all"_l, "test"_l);`                                          |
| `list`         | Define a list of strings or tokens.                 | `list("item1"_l, "item2"_l);`                                          |
| `rule`         | Define a rule with specific bindings.               | `rule(compile, bind(command, "g++ -c in"_v, "-o out"_v));`             |
| `str`          | Create a string composed of literals or variables.  | `str("hello.o"_l);`                                                    |
| `ShadowDash`   | Finalize the manifest with all builds and settings. | `ShadowDash({build1, build2}, {pool1}, default_targets);`              |

### 2. Full Example

shadowdash_test/manifest_example.cc is a complete example of using the macros in `manifest.h` to define a build configuration.

## New Language Design Logic

### 1. Internal Components

The new language design revolves around the following key classes:

#### Token
Represents a basic element in the build system, with types:
- **LITERAL**: A fixed string value.
- **VAR**: A variable that can be dynamically substituted.

#### String Abstraction (`str_`)
Allows combining `Token`s into complex strings, useful for commands and paths.

#### Lists and Bindings
- **`list_`**: A collection of `str_` instances.
- **`binding`**: Key-value pairs used in rules to define behavior.

#### Rules
The `rule__` class defines how to process inputs, with:
- **Regular rules**: Contain bindings for commands.
- **Special rules**: Predefined behaviors like `phony`.

#### Builds
The `build` class represents a single build operation, with inputs, outputs, and an associated rule.

#### Pools
The `pool` class defines resource limits for concurrent tasks.

#### Defaults
The `shadowdash_default` class sets the default targets.

#### ShadowDash Manifest
The `ShadowDash_` class aggregates all builds, pools, and default targets into a single manifest.

## Summary

The `shadowdash_test/manifest.h` file provides:
1. **User-friendly macros** for defining builds and rules.
2. **Robust internal logic** to manage complex dependencies.
3. **Extensibility** for diverse project requirements.

By focusing on the foundational design of ShadowDashâ€™s new language, this module ensures seamless integration with other teams (Converter and Hello World Graph).
